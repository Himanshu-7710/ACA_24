          <h1>Who is Lebron james ?</h1>
		  <p>LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely considered one of the best NBA players in history, James is frequently compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player ever.[1] Playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Miami Heat, and the Lakers, James is the only player to have won NBA championships with three franchises as NBA Finals MVP.[2] He has competed in ten NBA Finals, eight of them consecutively with the Heat and the Cavaliers from 2011–2018. His accomplishments include four NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, four NBA Finals MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. During his 17-year career, James holds the record for all-time playoffs points, is third in all-time points, and eighth in career assists. James has been selected to the All-NBA Team a record 17 times (with a record of 13 First Team selections and 11 consecutive First Team selections, the latter of which is shared with Jordan and Karl Malone), made the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times, and has been named an All-Star 17 times, including three All-Star MVP selections.

			James played basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he was selected by Cleveland with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2003–04 Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, winning the NBA MVP Award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 to sign as a free agent with Miami. This move was announced in an ESPN special titled The Decision, and is one of the most controversial free-agent decisions in sports history.
			
			James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned league MVP and Finals MVP. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the franchise's first championship and ending Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought. In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 championship and was awarded his fourth Finals MVP.

          <h1>High school career </h1>
		  <p>As a freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[9] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[10] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.[11] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[12] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[9] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[9]

			Before the start of his junior year, James was featured in Slam, an American basketball magazine, and writer Ryan Jones lauded him as possibly "the best high school basketball player in America right now".[13] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[4]:104 With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[9] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[4]:117 St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[4]:114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[14][15] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[16]
			
			Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[4]:142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season.[4]:143 For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,[9] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[4]:178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[9] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[17]
			
			Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA superstar.[18] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[17] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[17] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[19] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[20] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[21]</p>

		  <p>
			Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg), James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions[271] but has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[272] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile, has drawn comparisons to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[119][273][274][30][275] Through the 2020–21 season, James's career averages are 27.0 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.6 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game.[40] Since 2011, he has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN and Sports Illustrated</p>

      <h1>Legacy</h1>
		<p>James left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[c] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[318] As of June 2020, he has been named to 16 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the first-team, which are both NBA records.[319] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[320] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[321] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[40] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[61][322] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships. His ten Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[d] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[324][325][326]

			On the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[e] and in December 2019, he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[333] In addition to praising James's on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted James's influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James's move to the Heat in 2010 "defined a decade of player movement", and that he "fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations."[334] James's fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: "We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that [...]. I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment."[335]
			
			James is also discussed within the context of being the greatest basketball player of all-time, which has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[1] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[336] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[337] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[338][339][340] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[339][340] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: "The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan."[340] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that "the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim" and that "in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse", Jordan having more titles and an "unblemished Finals record holds significant weight."[336]

      <h1>Public image</h1>
      <p>By 2015, James was considered by many people, including his fellow NBA players, to be the "face of the NBA".[354] His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; in 2014, he asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[355] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[356]

		Throughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[359][360] and in 2017, he was listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[361] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[362] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games versus the New York Yankees.[363] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and The Decision, he was listed as one of most disliked athletes in the US.[364] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[365] In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[366] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[367]
		
		Memorabilia associated with James is highly sought afteɾ; two of James's rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[368] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[369] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James's jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[370]
		
		In March 2008, James became the first black man—and third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney—to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen.[371] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and "memorable for the wrong reasons", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his light-skinned love interest.[357][358]
